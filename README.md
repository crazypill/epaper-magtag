This project was created because our dog does a really good job pretending that she hasn't been fed.  Sometimes it's difficult to know who fed her last without interrupting folks.  This project allows you to mark when you've fed the dog breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It also keeps track of how many snacks the dog has had.

Hope you find this project useful!  Enjoy.
